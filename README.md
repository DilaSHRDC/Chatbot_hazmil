Types of Bullet:
Full Metal Jacket (FMJ): These are the most common type of bullet. They have a hard metal jacket that encases a softer lead core. FMJ bullets are typically used for target practice and self-defense because they penetrate deeply and tend to stay together on impact.

Hollow-Point (HP): These bullets have a hollow cavity at the tip that expands on impact, causing more damage to the target. HP bullets are typically used for self-defense because they are designed to transfer more energy to the target and stop it quickly.

Soft Point (SP): These bullets have a soft lead tip that expands on impact, similar to hollow-point bullets. However, the expansion is typically less dramatic. SP bullets are often used for hunting because they can damage tissue while still preserving some of the meat.

Armor-Piercing (AP): These bullets are designed to penetrate armor. They have a hard metal core that can pierce through bulletproof vests and other protective materials. AP bullets are typically restricted for civilian use due to their potential lethality.

Wadcutters: These bullets have a flat nose and are designed to punch clean holes in targets. They are often used for target practice with revolvers because they minimize lead splatter.

Segmented Jacketed Hollow Point (SJHP): These are a type of hollow-point bullet with a jacket that separates on impact, creating larger wound channels. SJHP bullets are designed for self-defense to maximize stopping power.

Black Tip: These bullets typically have a steel core or penetrator tip designed for long-range shooting or penetrating barriers. Their use can be restricted depending on location.

Sizes & Pricing:
